# Assignment Starter Git

This is not a starter code for the git assignment, as the [git assignment](https://61d.org/docs/Assignments/git-md-bash) has no starter code. Instead, it contains the tests which will be run on the code you write for the assignment.

Place the url of your repository and nothing else in repo.txt. The repo must be public. The url should look something like this `https://github.com/facebook/react`

## Tests run
```bash
bun install
bun vitest
```

The tests check the contents of your `README.md` file, your `history.txt` file, and ensure that your GitHub repo has two merged pull requests. Make sure that all of your changes are pushed to GitHub, or the autograder will not be able to grade them.
